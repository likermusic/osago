## Quick Start

### `Set up npm auth if you yet to do it`

First of all go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and make new access token with all "repo" checkboxes and "read:packages" checkbox included.
Save that token as you'll need it just in few moments and you wont be able to see him again.

Then execute following commands:

```
rm ~/.npmrc
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@sravni
> Username: {your_username}
> Password: {your_token}
> Email: {your_ะต-mail}
```

login and password are domain/ActiveDirectory ones without the email, for example
'vasily.pupkin'.

OR

You can execute this if you have not logged already:

```
./npm-ci-set-up-auth.sh -t {your_token_here}
```

**Clone repo and install**

```
git clone git@github.com:sravni/<repo-name>.git <directory-name>
cd <directory-name>
yarn
```

### `env`

Create .env file in root. Copy settings from .env.example file and paste in .env.

### `API types`

Updated type generation for the server by running shell scripts
`yarn updateApiTypes`

### `yarn dev`

Runs the project in development mode.
You can view your application at `http://localhost:9001/osago/`

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn start`

Runs the compiled app in production.

You can again view your application at `http://localhost:9001`

### `rs`

If your application is running, and you need to manually restart your server, you do not need to completely kill and rebundle your application. Instead you can just type `rs` and press enter in terminal.

## Environment Variables

### Build-time Variables

**The following environment variables are embedded during the build time.**
